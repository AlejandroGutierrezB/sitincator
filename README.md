# Sitincator

"Sitincator" is [Simplificator's](https://www.simplificator.com) meeting room display system. It consists of a React/Electron app running on a Raspberry Pi 3, which is connected to a touch screen display.

The system shows the current occupancy of the meeting room on the display, all meetings of the current day and allows to make a reservation for 15 or 30 minutes. Sitincator reads the meeting information from Google Calendar.

## Software

Clone the repository and build a package for the Raspberry Pi:

    git clone https://github.com/simplificator/sitincator.git
    npm install
    npm run build:pi

The package for the Raspberry Pi now resides in `./Sitincator-linux-armv7l`. You can launch the app by calling `./Sitincator-linux-armv7l/Sitincator`.
